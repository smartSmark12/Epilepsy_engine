# Smark's Epilepsy Engine

## !! EPILEPSY WARNING !!

This project is a kind of my python and pygame playground, so feel free to modify or steal the code according to your needs <3

# Controls:
- Left-click: drag-draw points onto the screen
- Right-click: draw a single point
- Scroll: draw points onto the screen
- LShift: change color modes (normal > red > shaded-red > EPILEPSY!!!)
- LCtrl: change line modes (both > EPILEPSY > points-only > lines-only)
- Space: clear canvas
- S: take screenshot of current canvas
- F: toggle point auto-spawn
- G: splash 500 points onto the screen
- Up/Down keys: increase/decrease auto-spawn speed
- 1-5: save current canvas into a .csv file (./saved/saveX.csv)
- 6-0: load saved canvas from a .csv file
- Alt+f4: quit program

# Potential issues:
- Windows defender might have a problem with the .exe file
- Antivirus might not let you download the .exe file

## Solutions?
- I haven't found any solution for this problem yet, so if you find one, let me know
  - You could rebuild the program from the downloadable .py file (using pyinstaller)
